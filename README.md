# Customer-segmentation-to-boost-marketing-campaign

Marketing campaigns are sets of strategic activities that promote a businessâ€™s goal or objective. A marketing campaign could be used to promote a product, a service, or the brand as a whole. To achieve the most effective results, campaigns are carefully planned (Bigcommerce, 2022). 

A response model can provide a significant boost to the efficiency of a marketing campaign by increasing responses or reducing expenses. The objective is to predict who will respond to an offer for a product or service.

The main objective is to train a predictive model which allows the company to maximize the profit of the next marketing campaign.

In this notebook, we'll act as the data analyst for an anonymous company and seek to answer a few chief questions:

    What does the Average customer look like for our company?
    What Products and Channels of Revenue are best performing?
    Which Marketing Campaigns were most successful?
    What factors contribute to the success of our current campaign?

We'll attempt to answer these questions through Visualization as well as complex machine learning models, like Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithms, and Support Vector Machines to see if we can find contributing factors to the success of our past campaigns.
